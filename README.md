# Menu Maker

(**UPDATE : 2020.07.13 :** v2 of this app will soon release with major ui, db and menu output changes . I will be probably releasing that as a private product. 
this project is currently [archieved](https://github.com/root-ansh/Menu-Maker_v1/tree/b0ad6b93994be8f4004d414d818539dcb2a1e4e3)
:smile: )

This is a small utility app that I mainly made for my mom and dad's Resteraunt. We are clients of online food markets 
like swiggy and zomato, and these companies usually ask for a copy of updated menu everytime we want to make changes to the online version of
menu.This creates a problem for use , since we can't afford to get 1000 new menu's printed for just a single correction

With this app, A lot of hassles are solved for resteraunt owners because they can now keep a list of all their items in 
the app itself. All the content is easy to create, access and modify. And whenever they want to make changes to their online
profile, they can make those changes in the app too, and easily generate a temporary , less fancy menu PDF for online validation.
